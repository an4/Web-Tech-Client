    "text" : "The Englischer Garten, German for \"English Garden\", is a large public park in the centre of Munich, Bavaria, stretching from the city centre to the northeastern city limits. With an area of 910 acres, the Englischer Garten is one of the world's largest urban public parks, larger than New York's Central Park. The name refers to its English garden form of informal landscape, a style popular in Britain from the mid-18th century to the early 19th century and particularly associated with Capability Brown."
